The starting is 46k, and every 6 months for 2 years I will be getting a guaranteed raise of up to 12% (3 times total).

They want me to use this for a down payment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a while now I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to buy a house as soon as possible. The price range for a house that I want is around 175k to 200k. At my new salary, I could afford the monthly payment, especially since I have the 36k to put down and will be getting consistent raises. I haven&amp;#39;t been pre-approved yet, but I&amp;#39;m thinking about doing that sometime this month. I know that the loan processor will want to see my credit rating, bank statements, salary, etc. I&amp;#39;m a little weary on doing that right now, since I literally JUST started at my new salary of 46k, and I haven&amp;#39;t actually gotten any pay stubs yet, and won&amp;#39;t get any until the end of June (I get paid biweekly, and they are 2 weeks delayed from when I actually worked).  However, this has been a consistent job for about 4 years, and the new salary is really just a pay raise from my previous 32k. My existing position is being kept, and it&amp;#39;s just converted. As far as I understand the loan process, they just want to see that you have a stable job, which I do, but I will be getting paid more from now on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other financial information:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\nCredit rating is 741.\nTotal CC debt is ~$600.\nTotal credit limit is 14.5k\nI have no other debt -- my car loan was paid off in my name (thanks parents!).\nI have no substantial savings, other than the 36k for down payment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other information that may or may not be important:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\nA little over a year ago I applied for my first credit card, got approved for 2.5k limit.\n3 months ago I applied for an Amazon credit card and got approved for $500 limit.\n2 weeks ago I called for an increase to my 2.5k credit card limit and got approved to 7k limit.\n2 weeks ago I also applied for a new credit card and got approved for a 7k limit (was probably a bad move due to the hard inquiries).\nI have no issues with managing debt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, I guess my question is...&lt;/strong&gt; Do you think I should get pre-approved this month, and try to buy a house by August/September...or do you think that this is a bad idea?
